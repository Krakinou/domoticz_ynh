> *This package allows you to install domoticz quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.  
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview
Domoticz is a Home Automation system design to control various devices and receive input from various sensors.
For example this system can be used with: 

* Light switches
* Door sensors
* Doorbells
- Security devices
- Weather sensors like: UV/Rain/Wind Meters
- Temperature Sensors
- Pulse Meters
- Voltage / AD Meters
- And more ...


**Shipped version:** Always the last stable one. The last compiled version is retrieved from [this directory](https://releases.domoticz.com/releases/?dir=./beta)
Once installed, **updates from the uptream app are managed from within the app.**. Yunohost upgrade script will only upgrade the Yunohost package. 


## Configuration

### Sensors, language and this kind of stuff
Main configuration of the app take place inside the app itself.

### Access and API
By default, access for the [JSON API](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL's) is allowed on following path `/yourdomain.tld/api_/domoticzpath`.
So if you access domoticz via https://mydomainname.tld/domoticz, use the following webpath for the api : `/mydomainname.tld/api_/domoticz/json.htm?yourapicommand`

By default, only sensor updates and switch toogle are authorized. To authorized a new command, you have (for now) to manually update the nginx config file :
````
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/yourdomain.tld.d/domoticz.conf
````
Then edit the following block by adding the regex of the command you want to allow:
````
  #set the list of authorized json command here in regex format
  #you may retrieve the command from https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL's
  #By default, sensors updates and toggle switch are authorized
  if ( $args ~* type=command&param=udevice&idx=[0-9]*&nvalue=[0-9]*&svalue=.*$|type=command&param=switchlight&idx=[0-9]*&switchcmd=Toggle$) {
    set $api "1";
    }
````
For example, to add the json command to retrieve the status of a device (/json.htm?type=devices&rid=IDX),modify the line as this:
````
  #set the list of authorized json command here in regex format
  #you may retrieve the command from https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Domoticz_API/JSON_URL's
  #By default, sensors updates and toggle switch are authorized
  if ( $args ~* type=command&param=udevice&idx=[0-9]*&nvalue=[0-9]*&svalue=.*$|type=command&param=switchlight&idx=[0-9]*&switchcmd=Toggle$|type=devices&rid=[0-9]* ) {
    set $api "1";
    }
````

All IPv6 and IPv4 address within the local network (192.168.0.0/24) are authorized as API.
As far as I know, there is no way to use such filter for IPv6 address : You may remove the authorization by removing or commenting this line in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/yourdomain.tld.d/domoticz.conf`:
````
allow ::/1;
````
This will authorized only IPv4 within local network to access your domoticz API.
You may add individual IPv6 address in the same way.

## Documentation

 * Official documentation: Please use the [wiki](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Main_Page) and [user manual](https://www.domoticz.com/DomoticzManual.pdf) for further info.
 * YunoHost documentation: If specific documentation is needed, feel free to contribute.

## YunoHost specific features

#### Supported architectures

Both ARM and x86 architectures should be supported.
Compiled sources are directly downloaded by the package.

## Limitations

* No user management nor LDAP integration This function is [not planned to be implemented into the app](https://github.com/domoticz/domoticz/issues/838), hence it's not planned into the package neither.
* Backup cannot be restored on a different machine type (arm, x86...) as compiled sources are different
